Principal Dynamic Mode (PDM) Analysis
============================================

-------------
Introduction
-------------
Principal Dynamic Mode (PDM) analysis is a non-parametric framework to estimate a system's nonlinear dynamics. Built on top of a Volterra series expansion, PDM analysis is a way to segregate the linear from the nonlinear dynamics of a system. Performing such an analysis opens a new window to view the structure of the system - something traditional kernal & non-parametric approaches typically lack.

Essentially a signal processing technique, PDM analysis uses a Volterra-Laguerre expansion framework to model the system's output. A Volterra series, which is similar to a Taylor series expansion in structure, has the added benefit of capturing 'memory' effects. However direct estimation of the higher order kernals is challenging for a pure Volterra series due to the nonlinearities, so the kernals are estimated using Laguerre Basis Functions. 

PDM analysis has been used in neuroscience and electrical engineering because of the timeseries-like nature of the measurements in these fields.

General Procedure

Generate Model
===============

Data
------
#. Input Data X (N-dim, M-Samples, frequency)
#. Clean Data (resample, interpolate, de-mean, etc.)


Kernal Estimation
------------------
#. Estimate the Laguerre coefficients directly from the data
    - Generate (get) :math: `L` laguerre functions. Provide N exponential scaling factors :math: `\alpha_n` (_0.5_, :math: `\alpha_n \in \left[0,1\right], n \in \left[1,2,...,N\right])`
    - Estimate Laguerre Basis Function weighting, :math: `V` using L.S. Regression (LS is naive; Other estimation techniques possible here). 
        .. math:
            
            X = \sum_{l=1}^L {V_l \dot L_l^{\alpha}\left(x\right)
        ..
        
#. Estimate Kernals using Laguerre basis functions :math: `L` & their coefficients :math: `V`
    - Kernal is the convolution of the Laguerre basis functions with their coeficients.
    
Principal Dynamical Modes
--------------------------
#. Estimate the linear dynamics using singular value decomposition of the kernal estimates.
#. Estimate the so-called "Static non-linearities" using a P-order (_P=3_) polynomial
